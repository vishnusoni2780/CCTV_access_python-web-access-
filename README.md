# CCTV_access_python-web-access-


In this i have done a very good use of graphical presentation, Banner, then choice of user, and then fetching IP Addresses of CCTV cameras from world biggest directory of online surveillance security cameras [ www.insecam.com ] using python language & it's various Modules/Packages.


# Modules of Python Used :-

 requests   =   To make HTTP Request from python to website
 
 platform [ platform() ]    =   to retrieve information about the platform on which the program is being currently executed
 
 time [ sleep() ]   =   used for transition effect in execution to look more interective
 
 os [ system(delet) ]    =   to clear the previous CMD screen/ to totally blank the screen
 
 re   =   to make store the retrieved data in a specified manner using Regular expression. 
 

# Execution of Code in CMD :-

 # Phase 1 :
            Previous Screen of CMD will be cleared totally.
 # Phase 2 :
            A small text "loading module" will be pop up and 
            it is design in such a that every latter seems to be popup with getting Capital letter in loop two times.
 # Phase 3 :
            after this small transition effect, 
            a banner named as "WEB HACK" will be displayed over there 
            and yes i have inserted a small transition effect for designing purpose to make it interactive and this is that every letter of Banner will be displayed one by one 
            covering complete word.
 # Phase 4 :
            Version info will be displayed for 3 seconds
 # Phase 5 :
            A small welcome text will be there.
            and there is choices of 15 country which user will select according to number prescribed there.
 # Phase 6 :
            now from here, the real execution starts.
            The pair [ IP:PORT ] is printed on CMD of available CCTV Cameras and along with these data will automatically store in a 'log.txt'.
 # Phase 7 :
            Here you have got all [ IP:PORT ] pairs and 
            now your final task to access a live CCTV Camera and for this copy any [ IP:HOST ] pair and paste in browser ( Mozilla Firefox preffered )
            and you will get the access to live CCTV only if there is no password set by owner although there are varioud camera which are password less and can be access.

  - write command in CMD
